Appellant’s Opening Brief</h1>
<p>The written briefs are the most important part of an appeal. Because there is no new trial during an appeal, the Court of Appeal makes a decision based on what they read in the written briefs, the record on appeal, and in legal research.</p>
<p>The first written brief is the opening brief. It is the case for appeal prepared by the appellant. The opening brief argues why the trial court made a legal mistake, how the mistake impacted the decision, what could be corrected or reversed in the judgment, and why the judgment should be reversed.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to prepare an opening brief.</p>

<h2>Timeline of an Opening Brief</h2>
<p>After filing documents to designate the record, the next step is to prepare the opening brief. Once the record on appeal is filed, the Court of Appeal notifies the appellant of the opening brief due date. The deadline is generally 40 days after the Court of Appeal sends notice of the filing of the record on appeal. If the appellant prepares an appendix and does not request a reporter’s transcript, then the appellant has 70 days from the date they file the election to proceed by appendix (rule <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=eight&#038;linkid=rule8_124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8.124 election</a>) in the trial court.</p>
<h2>Preparing an Opening Brief</h2>
<p>Appeals are won or lost on the briefs, so the appellant needs to spend time researching and writing a persuasive, concise legal argument. It’s a good idea to start working on the opening brief as soon as the notice of appeal is filed. This will allow as much time as possible to complete all of the necessary information in the required format.</p>
<p>Remember an appeal is not a retrial of the facts. The Court of Appeal only considers legal issues or mistakes made by the trial court. So an effective opening brief will focus on legal issues. The appellant should review what’s in the record, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ruling, decision, or judgment of the trial court judge</li>
<li>the statutes, constitutional provisions, case decisions, and other legal authorities that the trial court judge used to support the decision</li>
</ul>
<p>To win an appeal, the appellant must prove that the trial court made a legal mistake <strong>and</strong> that the mistake impacted the decision. This is hard to do because the Court of Appeal generally defers to the trial court’s decision, unless it is de novo review.  The burden is on the appellant to present a legal argument in the opening brief that convinces the Court of Appeal to reverse the trial court’s order or judgment.</p>
<h2>Outline of an Opening Brief</h2>
<p>There are several sections in an opening brief. While all of them are important, some sections take more time and effort to write than others.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of each section with a description of what it includes.</p>
<p><strong>All of the sections are required.</strong></p>

<li>there is an order (usually this order comes after the judgment, or after a hearing in a family law or probate case)</li>

<p>The Statement of Facts should only include “significant facts,” meaning facts that are related to the legal issue or issues the appellant discusses in the appeal.</p>
<p>No new facts or evidence can be introduced in the Statement of Facts. The Statement of Facts can only mention facts or evidence presented in the trial court and included in the record on appeal.</p>

The appellant also explains how the mistakes caused so much harm or “prejudice” that there should be a retrial, or that the judgment should be reversed or changed.</p>
<p>The appellant must do several things in the argument:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Present the legal issues of the appeal<br />
</strong>Each legal issue must be discussed separately under its own heading. The heading should summarize the issue in a few words. In the discussion, the appellant should identify the standard of review that applies to the issue. The standard of review is basically the rules or guidelines the court uses to decide whether the trial court made an error in its decision. Different kinds of rulings require different guidelines. So the appellant has to research what the standard of review will be for each issue. After identifying the standard of review, the discussion should then explain the legal error the trial judge made, and how that legal error harmed (“prejudiced”) your case. The appellant should support the discussion with statements of law. <a href="https://selfhelp.appellate.courts.ca.gov/knowledge-center/opening-brief/#toggle-id-6">See a list of common legal issues in an appeal</a></li>
<li><strong>Discuss the standard of review<br />
</strong>The standard of review is the rules or guidelines the Court of Appeal uses to decide whether the trial court made a mistake. Different kinds of legal issues are reviewed by different rules. The court requires an appellant to include a standard of review for each legal issue in the opening brief. So the appellant needs to research what the standard of review is for each issue.</li>
<li><strong>Include legal authorities that prove the trial court is wrong<br />
</strong>The appellant’s argument must include a reference to a legal authority for every statement of law arguing why the trial court’s decision is wrong.<br />
A legal authority can be a case decision, statute, rule of court, book written about the law, constitutional provision, or legal treatise. The appellant must explain how the legal authority applies to the facts in the case.</li>

<p>Briefs prepared on a <strong>typewriter</strong> cannot be more than <strong>50 pages</strong>.</p>
<p>Briefs prepared on a <strong>computer</strong> cannot be more than <strong>14,000 words</strong>.</p>
<p>The word count includes footnotes, but it <em>does not</em> include the cover, the Certificate of Interested Entities or Persons, the Tables of Contents and Authorities, the Certificate of Compliance, any signature block, proof of service forms, or any attachments.</p>
<p>The appellant can attach a maximum of 10 pages of documents to the end of the brief.</p>
<p>If needed, an appellant can ask the Court of Appeal to allow a longer brief. The appellant would file an “Application to File an Oversized Brief” with the Court of Appeal and serve a copy of the application to all other parties in the case. There is no court form for this application so the appellant types the application on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The appellant must provide what the court calls “good cause” – which means a good reason – to file an oversized brief. The court may or may not say yes to the request.</p>

<p>Generally, you must serve a copy of the opening brief to all parties in the case, to the trial court judge, and to the Supreme Court of California <strong>BEFORE</strong> it can be filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>If the other party <em>has a lawyer</em>, then the brief is served to the lawyer. If the other party <em>does not have a lawyer</em>, then the brief is served to the other party.</p>
<p>There are rules about who can serve a brief and how it can be served.</p>
<p>The appellant must give the Court of Appeal proof that all of the required copies were delivered. Appellants are encouraged to use court form <a href="https://selfhelp.appellate.courts.ca.gov/forms/app009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APP-009</a> (mail or in person) or <a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/app009e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APP-009E</a> (electronic to provide proof of service. This form tells the court who served the brief, who was served with the brief, how the brief was served, and the date it was served. The appellant must file one proof of service of service form for each brief that is delivered.</p>
<p>Proof of service forms are always included at the end of the opening brief, after the Certificate of Compliance.</p>

<h2>Next Steps after the Opening Brief</h2>
<p>The opening brief is the first in a series of three briefs. Next the other party – who is called the respondent – can file a respondent’s brief that addresses the issues raised in the opening brief. Then the appellant has an opportunity to file a final brief called a reply brief that addresses what’s included in the respondent’s brief.</p>
<p>The appellant is not required to file a reply brief, and the appellant only files a reply brief if the respondent files a brief.</p>

<p>There are many legal issues that might be raised by an appellant in the opening brief. Here are some of the most common legal issues raised in an appeal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trial judge erroneously admitted evidence over objection, and the inadmissible evidence prejudiced the appellant’s case.</li>
<li>The trial judge erroneously refused to admit relevant evidence and thus prejudiced the appellant’s case.</li>
<li>The jury instructions were legally incorrect.</li>
<li>The trial judge misinterpreted the parties’ contract that was in dispute.</li>
<li>The trial judge misapplied or misinterpreted statutory, common law (case decisions), or constitutional law.</li>
<li>The trial judge erred in sustaining a demurrer to the appellant’s complaint because the complaint legally states a cause of action.</li>
<li>The trial judge erred in granting summary judgment because there are material, disputed facts that require a trial.</li>
<li>The trial judge or jury made a mathematical or other error in computing the amount of damages.</li>
<li>The trial judge erred in awarding costs or attorney’s fees.</li>
<li>The findings of the trial judge do not support the decision.</li>
<li>The evidence is legally insufficient to support the findings or to support the judgment judgment.</li>
</ul>

<section class="av_toggle_section"  itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"  >    <div class="single_toggle" data-tags="{All} "  >        <p data-fake-id="#toggle-id-15" class="toggler "  itemprop="headline"   >How is the Statement of Facts prepared if there was no trial?<span class="toggle_icon" >        <span class="vert_icon"></span><span class="hor_icon"></span></span></p>        <div id="toggle-id-15-container" class="toggle_wrap "  >            <div class="toggle_content invers-color "  itemprop="text"   ><p>The statement of facts in an appeal brief will be different if the case was dismissed without a full trial.</p>
<p>Cases are commonly dismissed without a full trial in two ways: demurrer or summary judgment. If there was no trial in your case, you should consider doing legal research or talking to a lawyer to get help preparing your Statement of Facts.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Here are some general considerations for an appeal of these common types of dismissals.</p>
<p><strong>Demurrer<br />
</strong>A demurrer ruling is an order but by statute it may be appealed. The order must say the case is dismissed. The Court of Appeal usually only looks at the complaint and assumes all the factual allegations are true in order to rule on whether the complaint states a cause of action. The Statement of Facts in the respondent’s brief should include facts that support the trial court’s demurrer ruling and facts as stated in the complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Summary judgment<br />
</strong>A trial court’s ruling granting summary judgment is an order. A party seeking to appeal the ruling must first get a <em>judgment </em>based on that ruling. The facts are taken from the evidence before the trial court at the time of its ruling. A common issue for appeal is whether the trial court was correct that there was no genuine dispute as to material facts that must be resolved at a trial.</p>

<section class="av_toggle_section"  itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"  >    <div class="single_toggle" data-tags="{All} "  >        <p data-fake-id="#toggle-id-16" class="toggler "  itemprop="headline"   >What is the standard of review?<span class="toggle_icon" >        <span class="vert_icon"></span><span class="hor_icon"></span></span></p>        <div id="toggle-id-16-container" class="toggle_wrap "  >            <div class="toggle_content invers-color "  itemprop="text"   ><p>The Court of Appeal’s job is to determine if the trial court followed the law and how to resolve any issues if the trial court did not follow the law. To do this, the court uses a process that’s called the “standard of review.” These are basic guidelines to help the court evaluate the appellant’s argument.</p>
<p>The standard of review is different for each legal issue. The three most common standards of review are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>De novo standard.</strong> In de novo review, the Court of Appeal does not defer to the decisions made in the trial court. Instead the Court of Appeal looks at the issue as if the trial court had never ruled on it. This type of review is generally limited to issues involving questions of law. It is the most favorable standard of review for an appellant.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Abuse of discretion.</strong> During a trial, the judge uses his or her discretion to decide on many things. This includes whether or not to allow discovery, admit evidence, issue restraining orders, award damages, and more. When an appellant argues that “abuse of discretion” applies in the case, they must prove that the trial judge’s decision “exceeded the bounds of reason.” Since the Court of Appeal generally defers to the trial court’s exercise of discretion, this type of appeal is difficult to win.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Substantial evidence.</strong> This standard is used when an appellant is arguing against the factual findings of a judge or jury after a trial. The Court of Appeal reviews the record and decides whether a reasonable fact-finder could have come to the same conclusion as the trial court. The Court of Appeal does not decide whether it would have reached the same factual conclusions as the judge or jury. This kind of appeal is difficult to win because it argues that the trial court did not consider or understand all the evidence, believed the wrong witnesses, or failed to properly weigh the evidence. The Court of Appeal will reject this kind of argument if there is any substantial evidence—contradicted or not—that supports the trial court’s finding of the facts.</li>

Look for books that are written about the area of law that the case involves. For example, search in the area of contract law if a case involves a possible breach of contract for work that was not done or work that was not done properly. A librarian can suggest books to read about different areas of law.</p>
<p>Books written about the law—also called “secondary sources”—will include cases previously decided in all areas. Based on the legal information gathered and the facts of the case, the appellant can make a list of the issues he or she wants to raise. These can be issues the appellant thinks hurt his or her case in superior court the most, or the issues that will help his or her case in the appeal.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of places information can be found in the record on appeal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appellant’s appendix—AA</li>
<li>Appellant’s opening brief—AOB</li>
<li>Appellant’s reply appendix—ARA</li>
<li>Appellant’s reply brief—ARB</li>
<li>Augmented clerk’s transcript—Aug CT</li>
<li>Augmented reporter’s transcript—Aug RT</li>
<li>Clerk’s transcript—CT</li>
<li>Joint appendix—JA</li>
<li>Reporter’s transcript—RT</li>
<li>Respondent’s appendix—RA</li>
<li>Respondent’s brief—RB</li>
<li>Superior court file—SC file</li>
<li>Supplemental clerk’s transcript—SCT</li>
<li>Supplemental reporter’s transcript—SRT</li>
</ul>
<p>Each case is different. Some cases have all these sources in the record on appeal, and some cases only have a few of these sources.</p>
<p>In your brief, you will support each event or fact with a reference to a page number in one of the sources in this list. You will use the abbreviation that matches the source to tell the Court of Appeal where to look for the information. The court will check each reference to make sure it supports your version of the story.</p>
<p>For example, say you want to tell the court a fact about the case that’s on page one of the clerk’s transcript. Here’s what you would write in the brief: “Appellant filed a civil complaint on January 3, 2018. (CT 1)”</p>
<p>If there is more than one volume of the clerk’s transcript or reporter’s transcript, you’ll need to write the volume number, then CT or RT, and then the page number. For example: (1 CT 3), (2 RT 150).</p>
<p>If there is more than one augmented clerk’s transcript, also include the transcript by date. For example: (1/3/18 Aug CT 2).</p>

<p>If you need to file more than 10 pages of attachments, you can ask the Court of Appeal for permission. You may file a “Request to Attach Additional Exhibits” with the Court of Appeal and serve a copy of the application to all other parties in the case. There is no court form so you type the request on a piece of paper. You must provide what the court calls “good cause” – which means a good reason – to attach additional exhibits.</p>
<p>The court may or may not say yes to your request.</p>
<p>Instead of including a lot of attachments, it may be easier to simply make a reference in your brief to any legal authorities, or to exhibits already in the record on appeal.</p>

<p>Serving a document means delivering a copy of the document to another party, or delivering a copy to a different court than the one where you are filing the document.</p>
<p>Generally, you must serve a copy of the opening brief to all parties in the case, to the trial court judge, and to the Supreme Court of California <strong>BEFORE</strong> it can be filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serving documents to other parties.</strong>There are three ways to serve a document to another party: by mail, in person, or electronically. <u>If you want to serve a document electronically, you will first need to get the recipient to agree.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>A party to the case can serve a brief electronically. The court has rules about who can serve a document by mail or in person. It must be a person who is over 18 and lives in the county where they are serving. A party to the case cannot serve a document by mail or in person to another party. If the other party <strong>has a lawyer</strong>, then the document is served to the lawyer. If the other party <em>does not have a lawyer</em>, then the document is served to the other party.</p>
<p>If you submit your document electronically, there’s an option to have TrueFiling™ serve your document electronically to the other parties before your document is filed with the trial court or Court of Appeal. TrueFiling™ will automatically attach an electronic proof of service to any documents you electronically file (e-file).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serving documents to the trial court</strong>. The trial court may be served by mail and some trial courts may be served electronically. Always check with your trial court to see if they accept electronically served documents.</li>
<li><strong>Serving documents to the California Supreme Court</strong>. The Supreme Court may be served either by mail or electronically. If a brief is served on paper, the Supreme Court must receive 4 copies. If a document is filed electronically through TrueFiling™, it automatically fulfills the service requirements for the California Supreme Court.</li>

An extension or stipulation must be filed in the Court of Appeal <strong>before the date the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brief</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is due</strong>. Stipulations must be signed by all parties and served to all parties.</p>
<p>Note: The parties cannot stipulate to extend the time if the court has already granted an extension to file the brief.</p>
<p>If a party needs more time to file and has already stipulated to 60 days <em>or</em><em> </em>if the parties are unable to agree to an extension, a motion or application for extension of time may be filed with the Court of Appeal. The court may or may not grant the extension for more time.</p>
