Appellant’s Reply Brief</h1>
<p>The appellant’s reply brief is the final brief of the appeal process. The reply brief is optional.</p>
<p>The appellant’s only job in the reply brief is to challenge the legal arguments in the respondent’s brief. The appellant does not need to file a reply brief if they believe there are no legal issues in the respondent’s brief that must be addressed.</p>
<p>The appellant cannot raise new issues in the reply brief or repeat arguments from the opening brief.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of what to expect in this step of the appeal process and how to write an appellant’s reply brief.</p>

<h2>Timeline of an Appellant’s Reply Brief</h2>
<p>The appellant files a reply brief and proof of service with the Court of Appeal within 20 days after the respondent’s brief is filed.</p>
<p>The appellant must serve a copy of the reply brief to all parties in the case, the trial court judge, and the Supreme Court of California <strong>BEFORE</strong> filing the original reply brief with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>If the respondent does not file a respondent’s brief then the appellant does not file a reply brief.</p>
<p>There is no default period and the appellant will not receive a notice from the court about the deadline to file a reply brief.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>If an appellant needs more time to file a reply brief</em></strong>, they must give the Court of Appeal good cause and file a stipulation to extend time or file an application for an extension before the deadline to file the brief.</li>
<li><strong><em>If an appellant misses the deadline to file a reply brief</em></strong>, they can file a request with the Court of Appeal for permission to file a late brief. In this situation the court may or may not allow the appellant to file a late brief.</li>
<li><strong><em>If the Court of Appeal returns a reply brief for corrections</em></strong>, the court will give the appellant additional time to correct the brief, and to serve and file it again.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost of Filing an Appellant’s Reply Brief<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>There is no additional cost to file an appellant’s reply brief.</p>
<h2>Preparing an Appellant’s Reply Brief</h2>
<p>The reply brief is the second and final brief written by the appellant.</p>
<p>The reply brief is very different from the appellant’s opening brief. The reply brief has a limited purpose, so there are a limited number of sections. That means it will usually take the appellant less time to research and write the reply brief than it takes to complete the opening brief.</p>
<p>Before writing a reply brief, the appellant should carefully review the legal arguments and legal authorities in the respondent’s brief. The appellant must:</p>
<ol>
<li>decide which legal issues (if any) in the respondent’s brief need to be addressed <em>and</em></li>
<li>focus on those issues when researching and writing the reply brief.</li>
</ol>
<p>The argument is the heart of the appellant’s reply brief. The appellant should spend the most time making a persuasive legal argument against the specific legal issues they identified in the respondent’s brief.</p>

<p>There are strict rules about what the appellant can write about in the reply argument.</p>
<p><em><strong>What to include</strong> </em>This is what the appellant <strong>can do</strong> in the argument:</p>
<ul>
<li>address legal issues and arguments raised in the respondent’s brief</li>
<li>show how the respondent did not successfully argue against the legal issues raised in the appellant’s opening brief</li>
<li>address new legal authorities included in the respondent’s brief</li>
<li>provide new legal authorities to try and prove that the respondent’s legal arguments or authorities are not correct</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the appellant <strong>cannot do</strong> in the argument:</p>
<ul>
<li>raise new legal issues</li>
<li>repeat arguments made in the opening brief</li>
</ul>
<p><u>The Court of Appeal will ignore new legal issues and repeat arguments included in the appellant’s reply brief.</u></p>
<p><em><strong>How to organize the argument </strong></em></p>
<p>It is best to begin the argument section with an <strong>introduction</strong>. This is a short, one paragraph summary of the reply argument.</p>
<p>Then the appellant should reply to specific legal issues in the respondent’s brief. The appellant can choose which legal issues to address. That means the appellant does not have to reply to all of the respondent’s legal arguments. The appellant should focus on legal issues that are related to their argument for appeal.</p>
<p>The appellant’s reply argument needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>address the respondent&#8217;s issues or arguments one at a time</li>
<li>list each issue or argument under a separate heading or title</li>
<li>create a title for each issue or argument that is short and summarizes the appellant’s point</li>
<li>list the legal issues in the same order as they are listed in the respondent’s brief</li>
<li>include a statement of law for each issue or argument to show why the respondent is wrong</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remember, the appellant should not introduce new legal issues or repeat legal arguments here that are already discussed in the opening brief.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Referencing the record on appeal </strong></em></p>
<p>All briefs must follow the same rules about referencing the record on appeal:</p>
<ul>
<li>a brief can only discuss information that’s in the record on appeal</li>
<li>for every event or fact about the case that’s included in the brief, the appellant must provide an exact location and page number where the court can find it in the record on appeal</li>
</ul>
            </div>        </div>    </div></section>
<section class="av_toggle_section"  itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"  >    <div class="single_toggle" data-tags="{All} "  >        <p data-fake-id="#toggle-id-5" class="toggler "  itemprop="headline"   >Conclusion<span class="toggle_icon" >        <span class="vert_icon"></span><span class="hor_icon"></span></span></p>        <div id="toggle-id-5-container" class="toggle_wrap "  >            <div class="toggle_content invers-color "  itemprop="text"   ><p>This is usually one paragraph where the appellant:</p>
<ol>
<li>briefly summarizes the reply argument and</li>
<li>tells the Court of Appeal what relief they are asking for. Basically, this means what the appellant is asking the court to do. For example, the appellant can ask that the order or judgment be reversed, or that a new trial be granted.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note that no new arguments or issues should be addressed in the conclusion.</em></p>

Each brief must include a Certificate of Compliance saying that it meets the maximum length allowed by the court.</p>
<p>Briefs prepared on a <strong>typewriter</strong> cannot be more than <strong>50 pages</strong>.</p>
<p>Briefs prepared on a <strong>computer</strong> cannot be more than <strong>14,000 words</strong>. The word count <em>does include</em> footnotes but it <em>does not</em> <em>include</em> the cover, the Certificate of Interested Entities or Persons, the Tables of Contents and Authorities, the Certificate of Compliance, any signature block, proof of service forms, or any attachments.</p>
<p>The appellant can attach a maximum of 10 pages of documents or exhibits to the end of the brief.</p>
<p>If needed, an appellant can ask the Court of Appeal to allow a longer brief. The appellant would file an “Application to File an Oversized Brief” with the Court of Appeal and serve a copy of the application to all other parties in the case. There is no court form for this application so the appellant types the application on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The appellant must provide what the court calls “good cause” – which means a good reason – to file an oversized brief. The court may or may not say yes to the request.</p>

<p>Generally, you must serve a copy of the appellant’s reply brief to all parties in the case, to the trial court judge, and to the Supreme Court of California <strong>BEFORE</strong> it can be filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>If the other party <em>has a lawyer</em>, then the brief is served to the lawyer. If the other party <em>does not have a lawyer</em>, then the brief is served to the other party.</p>
<p>There are rules about who can serve a brief and how it can be served.</p>
<p>The appellant must give the Court of Appeal proof in writing that all of the required copies were delivered. Appellants are encouraged to use court form <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://selfhelp.appellate.courts.ca.gov/forms/app009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APP-009</a> (delivery by mail or in person) or <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/app009e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APP-009E</a> (electronic delivery)</span> to provide proof of service. This form tells the court who served the brief, who was served with the brief, how the brief was served, and the date it was served.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/app009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The appellant must file one proof of service of service form for each brief that is delivered</a>.</p>
<p>Proof of service forms are included at the end of the appellant’s reply brief, after the Certificate of Compliance.</p>

<h2>Filing the Appellant’s Reply Brief with the Court of Appeal</h2>
<p>There are two ways to file a brief: electronically file (e-file) on the computer or file on paper at the Court of Appeal. <em>Always check with your Court of Appeal to confirm the specific filing requirements and copy requirements in your case.</em></p>
<p>The Court of Appeal requires lawyers and people who have a lawyer to file electronically. If the appellant is self-represented – meaning they do not have a lawyer – then the appellant can choose to file electronically or file on paper.</p>
<p>If filing electronically, the court does not need or require paper copies.</p>
<p>If filing on paper, the original brief <strong>and</strong> proof of service forms are always given to the Court of Appeal. Some courts also require the appellant to file extra copies of the brief.</p>
<p>The appellant keeps one copy of the brief. It’s also a good idea to bring or mail an extra copy of the brief to the court clerk. The appellant can ask the clerk to stamp “filed” on the extra copy to show that the original was filed, and keep the extra copy as proof.</p>
<h2>Next Steps After the Appellant’s Reply Brief</h2>
<p>After all the briefs are filed and the Court of Appeal has had time to review them, the court will contact the parties to ask if they want to participate in oral arguments. All parties who file a brief that the Court of Appeal accepts will have an opportunity to make an oral argument. This is a chance for the parties to talk to the Court of Appeal justices in person and explain the arguments in their briefs.</p>

<p>But you <strong>can</strong> address new legal issues that the respondent wrote about. That means you can talk about legal issues that are in the respondent’s brief that are not in the appellant’s opening brief.</p>
<p>Also you <strong>can</strong> address the respondent’s arguments against the legal issues you discussed in your appellant’s opening brief. For example, you can say that the respondent’s legal authorities did not support their legal argument that the trial court decision was right.</p>

If the respondent chooses not file a brief, they will not be able to speak directly – or present an oral argument – to the Court of Appeal. That means the Court of Appeal will consider the appellant&#8217;s opening brief, the appellant’s oral argument, and the record on appeal. Then the court will make a decision.</p>

<p>The law says that the Court of Appeal must assume the trial court decision was correct unless the appellant proves there was an error, which means the law favors the respondent. So the law gives the appellant an opportunity to write a second brief to address the arguments made in the respondent’s brief. This is because the appellant has the burden of showing the Court of Appeal that the trial court made a mistake.</p>
<p>The appellant cannot make new legal arguments in the reply brief, so there is nothing new in the reply brief that the respondent needs to address.</p>

<p>For example, say you want to tell the court a fact about the case that’s on page one of the clerk’s transcript. Here’s what you would write in the brief: “Appellant filed a civil complaint on January 3, 2018. (CT 1)”</p>
<p>If there is more than one volume of the clerk’s transcript or reporter’s transcript, you’ll need to write the volume number, then CT or RT, and then the page number. For example: (1 CT 3) or (2 RT 150).</p>
<p>If there is more than one augmented clerk’s transcript, include the transcript date. For example: (1/3/18 Aug CT 2).</p>

<li>not citing the law (giving the court the name and place in a published court decision, statute, or other law) for what you say is the law in your brief</li>
<li>using improper citations that are not legal authorities, like a blog post or an unpublished court decision</li>
<li>improper or unprofessional tone (don’t use curse words or say bad things about people)</li>
<li>not proofreading (the brief has typos and other obvious errors)</li>

Improper attachments can cause a brief not to be filed, or to be rejected and returned for corrections.</p>
<p>Copies of exhibits or other materials may only be attached if they are already in the existing record on appeal, or in relevant local, state, or federal rules or regulations. The attachments must not be more than a combined total of 10 pages, unless the court grants you permission to break this rule.</p>
<p>If you need to file more than 10 pages of attachments, you can ask the Court of Appeal for permission. You may file a “Request to Attach Additional Exhibits” with the Court of Appeal and serve a copy of the request to all other parties in the case. There is no court form so you type the request on a piece of paper. You must provide what the court calls “good cause” – which means a good reason – to attach additional exhibits. The court may or may not say yes to your request.</p>
<p>Instead of including a lot of attachments, it may be easier to simply make a reference in your brief to any legal authorities, or to exhibits already in the record on appeal.</p>
<p>Before including attachments you should carefully review <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=eight&amp;linkid=rule8_204">CRC rule 8.204(d).</a></p>

Stipulations must be signed by all parties and served to all parties.</p>
<p>Note: The parties cannot stipulate to extend the time if the court has already granted an extension to file the brief.</p>
<p>If an appellant needs more time to file and has already stipulated to 60 days <em>or </em>if the parties are unable to agree to an extension, a motion or application for extension of time may be filed with the Court of Appeal. The court may or may not grant the extension for more time.</p>
<p>If an appellant misses the deadline to file a reply brief and did not file a stipulation or extension application before the deadline, he or she can still file a request with the Court of Appeal for permission to file a late brief. In this situation the court may or may not allow the appellant to file a late brief.</p>

Not all courts allow electronic filing.</em></p>
<p>Serving a document means delivering a copy of the document to another party, or delivering a copy to a different court than the one where you are filing the document.</p>
<p>Generally, you must serve a copy of the brief to all parties in the case, to the trial court judge, and to the Supreme Court of California <strong>BEFORE</strong> it can be filed with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serving documents to other parties.</strong>There are three ways to serve a document to another party: by mail, in person, or electronically. <u>If you want to serve a document electronically, you will first need to get the recipient to agree.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>A party to the case can serve a brief electronically. The court has rules about who can serve a document by mail or in person. It must be a person who is over 18 and lives in the county where they are serving. A party to the case cannot serve a document by mail or in person to another party. If the other party <em>has a lawyer</em>, then the document is served to the lawyer. If the other party <em>does not have a lawyer</em>, then the document is served to the other party.</p>
<p>If you submit your document electronically, there’s an option to have TrueFiling™ serve your document electronically to the other parties before your document is filed with the trial court or Court of Appeal. TrueFiling™ will automatically attach an electronic proof of service to any documents you electronically file (e-file).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serving documents to the trial court</strong>. The trial court may be served by mail and some trial courts may be served electronically. Always check with your trial court to see if they accept electronically served documents.</li>
<li><strong>Serving documents to the California Supreme Court</strong>. The Supreme Court may be served either by mail or electronically. If a brief is served on paper, the Supreme Court must receive 4 copies. If a document is filed electronically through TrueFiling™, it automatically fulfills the service requirements for the California Supreme Court.</li>

<p>The person who is serving a document must complete and sign a proof of service form when they deliver the document. The court requires this form as proof that the document was delivered to all parties in the appeal and the necessary courts.</p>
<p>The original proof of service forms should be attached as the last pages of the original document that you file in the court.</p>
<p>A copy of the proof of service forms must be attached as the last pages of each copy of the document that you serve to other parties.</p>

<p>The <strong>Court of</strong><strong> </strong>Appeal requires lawyers and people who have a lawyer to file electronically. If you are self-represented – meaning you do not have a lawyer – then you can choose to file electronically or file on paper.</p>
<p>If filing electronically, the Court of Appeal does not need or require paper copies.</p>
<p>If filing on paper in the Court of Appeal, the original document <strong>and</strong> proof of service forms are always given to the Court of Appeal. Some courts also require you to file extra copies of the documents.</p>
<p>You should always keep one copy of all documents you file with the court. It’s a good idea to bring or mail an extra copy of the document to the court clerk. You can ask the clerk to stamp “filed” on the extra copy to show that the original was filed, and keep the extra copy as proof.</p>
