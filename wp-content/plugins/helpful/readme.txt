== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I show votes after voting? =

You can. Simply use `{pro}` and `{contra}` in your texts to show the vote number.

= Can I use my own CSS files? =

You can. Choose `theme` as theme in the helpful options. Then create an `helpful` folder and an `theme.css` file in it. Fill the `theme.css` file with your CSS and you're done.

= Are there any shortcodes I can use? =

You can. Just use the shortcode `[helpful]` to output Helpful.

= Do I need to consider anything when reporting problems? =

Important are the PHP version and the plugin version. You can check the settings of the plugin. In the sidebar you will find what you are looking for.

= Is AMP supported by the plugin? =

I'm afraid not. I have not dealt with it and only know that there are problems with Javascript. If you have a solution, you are welcome to share it in the forum.

= I'm a programmer, can I help? =

Sure. Helpful is now also available on [Github](https://github.com/pixelbart/helpful). I will always update the code first and fix issues with Codacy. You are always welcome to help. Forke Helpful and start bullying!

= Can I output the author of the post? =

You can. Use `{author}` for it in your texts. The `display_name` of the author will then be used.

= How can I change the Helpful theme? =

Go to Design in the Helpful settings, or visit your WordPress Customizer. There you will find a Helpful menu item.

= How can I reset a single post? =

First you have to activate the Metabox in the Helpful settings. Once you have done this, a box will appear below the posts (in the admin area) where you can reset the post.

= My feedback is not displayed, what can I do? =

Switch to the Helpful settings and click on the System tab. There you will find the item Maintenance. Perform the maintenance once. Helpful will do the rest for you.
