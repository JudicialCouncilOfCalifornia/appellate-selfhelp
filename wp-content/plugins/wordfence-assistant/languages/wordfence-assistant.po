msgid "In rare cases, Wordfence users can accidentally lock themselves out of their system. Wordfence provides a built-in user-friendly system to regain access to your website which allows site administrators to send themselves an unlock email which contains a link that unlocks their website."

#: lib/mainMenu.php:11
msgid "Because Wordfence has become so popular, we see edge cases where systems administrators no longer have access to their old email address or the email unlock does not work for another reason. To help unlock sites with that problem, we've provided this plugin which you can install after you've removed Wordfence from your system. You can use this plugin to modify the Wordfence data in your database and disable the Wordfence firewall so that if you reinstall Wordfence the firewall won't lock you out again. You can also use this plugin to delete all Wordfence data."
