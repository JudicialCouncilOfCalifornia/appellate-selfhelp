**What is a 301 Redirect?**
A redirect is a simple way to re-route traffic coming to a *Requested URL* to different *Destination URL*.

A 301 redirect indicates that the page requested has been permanently moved to the *Destination URL*, and helps pass on the *Requested URLs* traffic in a search engine friendly manner. Creating a 301 redirect tells search engines that the *Requested URL*  has moved permanently, and that the content can now be found on the *Destination URL*. An important feature is that search engines will pass along any clout the *Requested URL* used to have to the *Destination URL*.

**When Should I use 301 Redirects?**
* Replacing an old site design with a new site design
* Overhauling or re-organizing your existing WordPress content
* You have content that expires (or is otherwise no longer available) and you wish to redirect users elsewhere

**Is the 404 error log GDPR friendly?**
The 404 error log does not collect user IPs. It collects the following data: timestamp of the event, the (404) URL that was opened, and the user-agent string.

**Having problems with SSL? Moving a site from HTTP to HTTPS?**
Install our free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-ssl/">WP Force SSL</a> plugin. It's a great way to enable SSL and fix SSL problems.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=What is a 301 Redirect?=
A redirect is a simple way to re-route traffic coming to a Requested URL to different Destination URL.

A 301 redirect indicates that the page requested has been permanently moved to the Destination URL, and helps pass on the Requested URLs traffic in a search engine friendly manner. Creating a 301 redirect tells search engines that the Requested URL has moved permanently, and that the content can now be found on the Destination URL. An important feature is that search engines will pass along any clout the Requested URL used to have to the Destination URL.

=I'm getting an error about the default permalink structure?=

301 Redirects requires that you use anything but the default permalink structure.

=My redirects aren't working=

This could be caused by many things, but please ensure that you are supplying valid URLs. Most common are extra spaces, extra slashes, spelling mistakes and invalid characters. If you're sure they're right, chances are your browser has cached the 301 redirect (in an attempt to make the redirection faster for you), but sometimes it doesn't refresh as fast as we would like. Clear your browser cache, or wait a few minutes to fix this problem.
My redirects aren't working - the old .html page still shows
For this plugin to work, the page must be within the WordPress environment. If you are redirecting older .html or .php files, you must first delete them. The plugin canâ€™t redirect if the file still exists, sorry! You should look into .htaccess redirects if you want to keep these files on your server.

=My redirects aren't getting the 301 status code=

Your Request or Redirect URLS may be incorrect; please ensure that you are supplying valid URLs. Check slashes. Try Viewing the page by clicking the Request URL - does it load correctly?

=How do I delete a redirect?=

Click the small X beside the redirect you wish to remove.

=How do I add wildcards. or folder redirects?=

Unfortunately this is not supported. You should look into <a href="https://wp301redirects.com/?ref=wporg">WP 301 Redirects PRO</a> for these advanced features.

=What about query strings?=

By default, any URL with a query string is considered unique, and will redirect to a unique page (if you so wish). The query string will be added to the Destination URL, which allows you to keep your tracking codes, affiliate codes, and other important data! If you want to have full control over query strings, ignore them, add or remove them consider upgrading to <a href="https://wp301redirects.com/?ref=wporg">WP 301 Redirects PRO</a>.

=What happens when I deactivate or delete the plugin?=

When you deactivate the plugin, obviously, redirects stop working. But, they are not deleted from your database. When you delete the plugin then the redirects are permanently deleted from the database along with any other data stored by the plugin in your database.

=Why is the error log limited to the last 50 errors?=

By default, the 404 error log is limited to the last (chronologically) fifty 404 errors. Since the log doesn't use a custom database table for storage but rather an array saved in WP options, 50 is a safe number that ensures the log works on all sites, that it doesn't take up too much space in the database and that it doesn't slow down the site.
The code imposes no limits on the log size and you can easily overwrite the default limit by using the <i>eps_301_max_404_logs</i> filter or by using the following code snippet to raise the limit to 200:
`add_filter('eps_301_max_404_logs', function($log_max) { return 200; });`

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/eps-301-redirects)
